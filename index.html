        <h1>The Anti-Racism Ambassadors Network (<abbr>ARAN</abbr>)</h1>
        <p>The Anti-Racism Ambassadors Network (the Network) was established to support existing efforts in the public service to <strong>dismantle systemic racism with an intersectional lens</strong>. The Network aims to create a space for public servants in Canada at the municipal, provincial, territorial and federal level, to share knowledge, spread information and take action.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Anti-Racism Ambassadors Network">ARAN</abbr> is different in that it is a grass-roots group of public servants volunteering from across Canada and not tied to any Government organization. Currently the Network acts as a community mobilizer and connector to collect, amplify, house and disseminate information and resources on Anti-Racism activity for all to use. In doing so, it will also amplify the work being done by <abbr title="black, Indigenous and people of color">BIPOC</abbr> colleagues and connect all people working in this space.</p>
        <p>It will also serve as a network to encourage and support members in taking practical action to dismantle systemic racism. We recognize that this is a community effort and it will take collective partnerships and action to affect change. This includes but is not limited to the work of existing networks like the Black Employees Network(s), Indigenous Employee Network(s), Visible Minorities Network(s), Federal Black Employees Caucus (FBEC), 2SLGBTQIA+/Pride networks and other similar communities as well as resources from organizations and departments standing up their own Anti-Racism units.</p>
        <p>As this Network grows, it aims to help bridge and identify gaps in the area of Anti-Racism across public service organizations in Canada where feasible.</p>

But it is sometimes interesting to browse through content to see what it includes and whether it represents your experience accurately and respectfully. The Indigenous Learning Series is a way for Indigenous employees to learn about other Indigenous groups that they may not identify with or would simply like to know more about.</p>

It is also a safe space to have real conversations about inclusion, anti‚Äëblack racism and discrimination.
